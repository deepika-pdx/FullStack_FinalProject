Thats what people feel when they hear Scatter The Atoms..The legacy that all but went South after the 60s went underground, but never disappeared. The bar was raised so high, no one could get there.

Born on May 17, 1972, in the notorious Waterhouse District, Andrew was exposed to and influenced by the best Reggae, R & B, and soul singers Jamaica had to offer. Do not miss this show! ---King Hopeton (Horace Campbell) was born March 25th on the beautiful island of St Ann, Jamaica West Indies. He started playing music at the age of 4 after watching an old woman on piano playing Come Back Charlie a classical piece. After she got up, he sat down and started playing the same piece of music as though he had played it before. When the lady came back and saw him playing, she immediately started to teach him and from that day all became history. His unique style is directly influenced by Classical music and Reggae roots where his work embodies elements of Jazz, Rhythm and Blues, Ska, Gospel, Alternative, Rock, Irish and Pop music. In addition to playing the piano, he also is multi-talented playing the Drums, Acoustic, Electric, Bass Guitar, and Organ.---- Zimbabwean AfroPop Maestro Zivanai Zi Masango welcomes his audience with his kind words, soulful vocals, and masterful guitar playing.

Black Star was recorded with a group of New York based jazz musicians, combining art rock with different styles of jazz, which makes this the perfect album for The Christopher Brown Quartet to interpret and perform.While Black Star will comprise the first set, the second set will be a tour of David Bowie classics, which will include commercial hits and album tracks, along with a chance for audience participation.For more information on Days of Bowie, including other events, please visit daysofbowie.com",2023-01-08T05:00:00Z,2023-01-08T05:00:00Z,,America/Los_Angeles,0,US,45.5194518,-122.6762911,"{""geometry"": {""coordinates"": [-122.6762911, 45.5194518], ""type"": ""Point""}}",zzw-224@5xc-jv7-ct9,,QafirYL7hhHQKkmLgFBLzH,The Jack London Revue,"529 Southwest 4th Avenue
